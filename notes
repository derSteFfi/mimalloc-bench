TODO
	put archives in extra storage (and somehow map that for CI)
		versionize archives for that
	hd: Makefile fix (build-bench-env.sh, line 612: port to patch?)
	gd: arc4random named a function getentropy which chalshes with a libc functions
	adapt CI-scripts to use Makefile
	we can give tar the list of files we want to extract or not extract
	package installation
		document in README
		move to CI instead of build_bench_env.sh

Decisions made:
	VERSIONS: demand versions instead of reporting them in the end
		bench.sh needs to be adapted in the way it finds 'installed allocators'
	switched from git cloning to grabbing a snapshot of the reqeuested version from github
	dh: move build directory (dh/src/build -> dh/build)
	lua: moved to extern benchmarks because it is built in extern/
	benchmarks: if something is updated, CMakeLists.txt needs to be touched (because bench/ is not part of the make logic at all)
		that could be fixed by suppplying a Makefile in bench/, too.
	sm: instead of default target, switched to building supermalloc only
	linux: updated version to LTS series
	lean: switched to smaller build target

open Questions:
	partial_checkout
		lp Also, github does not serve archives on that repo. Re-add when solved.
		scudo
	pa: re-add, but smaller? https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/base/allocator/partition_allocator
		build system uses depot_tools which come with problems, also does not compile even when installed
